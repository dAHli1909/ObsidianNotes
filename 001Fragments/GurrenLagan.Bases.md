# First Mecha Animes

Tomino as one of the first MECHA creators of his times; most of his characters speak in a very strange way. 
- Superobot
- Gundam 
- Getter Robo
# GurrenLagan.Gainax

"Gainax" comes from the *Giant* slang in Japanese; the x was added due to its cool sound. 
*Royal Space Force* was the first series done by Gainax ; *Gunbuster* is another known show.

Their characters generally move quite expressively. He also used drawn lens to show reflexiveness, conveying a certain manifestation of energy. The same applies for perspective and movement. *Illustrative and alive*. 
He didn't animate in a fixed number of frames, but used whatever he deemed necessary for the development of the proyect. He was the father of *Sakuga*[[]]. 
Stuff he actually made: 
- Birth

Hiroyuki Imaishi -> Simon

For me, a real man is someone who never abandons his beliefs.

```ad-quote
It is also worth clarifying that with being a key animator, it is their job to interpret that direct in therms of their own creative freedom
