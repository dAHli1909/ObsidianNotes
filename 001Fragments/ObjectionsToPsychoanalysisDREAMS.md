# ObjectionsToPsychoanalysis
1. The vagueness of the dream language doesn't imply it's impossible to use 
2. The processes of interpretation, done well, lead to 'objective' knowledge with the patient's information 
3. It's a window to the unconscious self; not just random stuff 
4. The dreams aren't per se altered. They can be "adjusted", but their core will remain untouched (generally)
