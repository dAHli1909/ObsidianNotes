# The K Means Algorithm
This encourages taking
appropriate measures based on knowledge discovery approaches. Machine Learning (ML) can be broadly classified into two: supervised and unsupervised learning.

Clustering is central to many data-driven applications and is considered an
interesting and important task in machine learning. It is also studied in statistics, pattern recognition,
computational geometry, bioinformatics, optimization, image processing, and in a variety of other
fields . A plethora of clustering techniques have been invented in the last decade, which are being
applied in a wide range of application domains

Clustering with different k values will eventually produce different
results. Different initialization problems that were analyzed in recent studies did not consider the
problem where the algorithm only converges to a poor local minima. In , an alternative approach
was adopted to prevent the k-means algorithm from being easily affected by noise and outlier values.
The authors presented a modified k-means algorithm based on self-paced learning theory.

The authors in [42] proposed an improvement to the vanilla k-means algorithm that prevents it
from getting stuck to a local minima. The improved algorithm incorporates cuckoo search along with
the k-means algorithm.
