# K-Means Clustering Algorithm Based on Improved Cuckoo Search Algorithm and Its Application

In other
words, clustering is the process of organizing similar objects
into groups [1]. K-means algorithm is a clustering algorithm
based on partition. Because of its simplicity and efficiency, it
has become one of the most widely used clustering algorithms

However, there are two shortcomings in the
original K-means algorithm: firstly, the difference between
each clustering result is greatly affected by the initial class
center; secondly, it is easy to fall into the local optimal
solution

The basic flow of the K-means algorithm is ad follows:
a) Randomly select k samples from the data set as the
initial cluster center.
b) Calculate the Euclidean distance between each
sample and the K centers, and divide the sample into its
nearest subset.
c) Calculate the mean of each subset as a new
clustering center.
d) Generate a new cluster center, return to step b,
otherwise the algorithm ends.
